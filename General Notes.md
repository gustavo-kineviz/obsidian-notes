- SeekerXR: Informações sobre pessoas, organizações e identidades em geral. É integrado com o graphXR. 
	- A API Seeker (inteface) não é da Kineviz

- SightXR: Can read documents like pdf and words. 
	- Crawler: Program that automatically goes into a website and collects data. It "scrapes"

- Grove: Implement things like dashboards. Like _Jupyter Notebook_

- You can't actually delete stuff like nodes, just the visualization 

- Select "key" to avoid duplicates

- It's possible to create shortcuts, leaving one less relationship

- Find Grove in extensions

Use more API instead of functions cause you can use AI in it

Wei wants to promote GraphXR as Business Intelligence 

Don't include keys directly into code
