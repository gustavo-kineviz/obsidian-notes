Hi, my name is Gustavo and today we're doing a demonstration of GraphXR’s Natural Language Interface, or NLI. Here I'm going to explore commands that can help us navigate, manipulate, and analyze a graph.

Let's start by creating some nodes: 
- Create 10 characters and give them random names. Each character has a height ranging from 1.5 M to 2 m
Then click here to proceed

Now let's make it so the height only shows two decimals
- Height property only has two decimals
Let's say we want to organize them by alphabetical order
- Order them in a line layout ordered by name
Ordering nodes in a line layout is great for spotting patterns in categorical data, like names or heights
It's also possible to order by height, for example:
- Order by height descending
- Set node size according to height

Let’s start with some basic navigation. With NLI, you can fly across the graph or focus on specific nodes effortlessly. Let's see some examples:
- Go to the center of the graph
- Go to [name]
- Rotate clockwise / rotate counter clockwise
- Move up / down
- Make it upside down

We can also make relationships:
- [name1] and [name2] are married
- [name3] dislikes [name4]
If the node does not exist already, it will be created
- [name5] has a son
- Each character owns an animal

Next, we can enhance our visualization by changing styles
- Make characters blue and animals green
- Cube layout to characters
- Sphere layout to animals
To a better visualization
- Expand animals

Now, let’s add some interactivity and analysis to refine our exploration:
- Select heights bigger than 1.7m
- Delete people starting with the letter G
- Filter characters who have a son

If that's our final visualization, we can:
- Make the graph keep rotating
- Set graph to full screen

Now to end our video:
- Delete all nodes that don't have relationships
- Delete all relationships
- Clear graph

Thank you for the attention, let me know in the comments if you have any questions, and see you next time.

Didn't work:
- Move forward/backward
- Create 20 (or more) people and give them random names
- Create 10 people and give them random names and ages
- Open/view [node] properties
- Take a screenshot
- Contract
- Sphere layout

Those are just some of the functionalities of the NLI
