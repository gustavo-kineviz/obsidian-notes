(Who what when where how, and why do them care)

June 30th, 2025. A Brazilian bank loses R$541 million in just 5 hours. 166 transactions. A web of shell companies and insiders who gave access to hackers.

Today, you’ll see how to unravel a case like this visually

INTRO
If you investigate financial crimes, you know the pain of:  
- Tracing funds through layers of accounts,  
- Spotting insider collusion in dense records,  
- Presenting complex cases to prosecutors.  

1. The Attack Surface
We start with the victim: BMP Bank. The attack node reveals it was a *supply chain attack*—hackers breached their tech provider, C&M Software.  
This is critical: most investigators miss third-party risks in their initial sweep*  

2. The Insider 
Meet João Nazareno. A C&M IT employee who confessed to giving hackers access for R$15,000.  

3. Following the Money
Now, the money flow. R$270 million went to Soffy Soluções, flagged as a suspected front.  
69 transactions. Frozen accounts.  

4. The Investigation Map
*"Here’s the power of visualization: the *entire investigation* in one view.  
- São Paulo Police tracking R$270 million frozen,  
- Secondary recipients like Carlos Silva (R$44 million),  
- And even a *second-layer destination* for R$522 million.  
No more flipping between spreadsheets and reports."*  

5. Stakeholder Storytelling
