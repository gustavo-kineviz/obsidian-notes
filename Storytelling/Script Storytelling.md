# Structure
## Hook
- Grab their attention with something relatable or a surprising insight
- Pose an intriguing question that will be answered through the demo
- Tease what will be taught in the video
- (Include an example)
## Set the context
- Introduce the specific data that will be used
- Explain why the tool is valuable in this scenario, and who will benefit from it:
	- Who is facing the problem? What's the obstacle? Why does it matter?
## Solution Demo
- Show the graph and explain what's going on
	- “Here’s our full dataset in GraphXR—every node is a customer, and edges represent support ticket interactions.”
- Show progressive discovery by adding complexity
- Highlight what the viewer _should feel_ with each tool: “Now it becomes obvious…” or “We wouldn’t have noticed this in a table…”
## Reveal the Impact
- The “aha!” moment, or a conclusion that shows the value. Tie it back to the problem or mystery you introduced.
## Outro
- Leave viewers with a sense of possibility.
	- “What stories are hidden in your data? Try it out on GraphXR and start connecting the dots.”
