## LLM
A powerful type of AI (specifically, a deep learning neural network, often based on the "Transformer" architecture) trained on **massive amounts of text and code data**.

It learns patterns, grammar, semantics, and vast amounts of world knowledge from this data. Its core task is to predict the next word (or "token") in a sequence, allowing it to generate human-like text, answer questions, summarize, translate, and even write code.

It's a "black box" – you don't explicitly program rules; it learns them implicitly from data. It excels at understanding and generating natural language and handling diverse, unstructured data.

## *GUI*
Short for **Graphical User Interface**, it's a type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation.

## Applet
A small computer program that performs a specific task

## Lambda
In JavaScript, **lambda** refer to **arrow functions**, which are a shorter and more concise way to write functions.

### CamelCase
Used in javascript since you can't use spaces

## snake_case
Spaces are replaced with underscore (" _ ") character, and words are written in lowercase.

## Anterograde Amnesia
A type of memory loss characterized by the **inability to form new memories after the onset of the condition**.

When the concept is applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), it refers to specific limitations in their ability to remember or retain new information, particularly beyond their initial training and within a conversation. It's a metaphor, as LLMs don't have brains or conscious experiences of forgetting like humans do.

Once a conversation or input exceeds this window, the LLM effectively "forgets" the earlier parts of the conversation. It can't refer back to information that has scrolled out of its current processing scope.

## Markdown
A **lightweight markup language** that allows you to write plain text documents using simple formatting syntax, which can then be converted into richly formatted output (like HTML). It's widely used in coding workflows for `README` files, documentation, and web content due to its readability and ease of use.

## Version control system
A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps track and manage changes to files (like code, documents, or projects) over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate, revert to previous versions, and avoid conflicts. Popular examples include **Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial**.
